	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I became interested in machine learning through an internship in visualization and stochastic modeling at the Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory, where I explored various visualization modules for plasma flow and topological constraints in tokamak engineering.
In addition, I interned at the Rutgers Cancer Institute where I studied particle trajectories and oxidative stress using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo and K-means clustering algorithms. I started to develop a general understanding of learning systems and adversarial
and tensor networks. Then I read a paper titled "The Mythos of Model Interpretability” by Zachary Lipton and have since
been interested in tasks of interpreting the behavior of machine learning models.
		
Broadly, I am fascinated by questions people are asking about how to design and implement fair machine learning; specifically, by
such questions asked in the context of classification protocols as in job screening, medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, and
”trolley problem” scenarios in autonomous driving. I am also drawn to discussions of jurisprudence in algorithms used in criminal
justice studies. Although quantifying social trade-offs of fair machine learning is interesting to me, I am more focused on legal
implications of everyday decision-making AI. I enthusiastically try to follow the research of the Berkman Klein Center, the Warren
Center for Network and Data Sciences, and the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.
		
At Caltech, I am involved in the Data Science Organization and the Muslim Students Association. I am a writing tutor for the Hixon
Writing Center and help undergraduate and graduate students with research and academic writing in history and philosophy. In
the scope of coursework, I have written to a modest extent about fair decision-making in autonomous driving and torts caused by
algorithms used in healthcare and corporate advertising.</p>
